Welcome to Weather App!

To run locally, run "npm install" and then "npm run dev" in your terminal.

You can find the project running at http://localhost:3000 in the browser of your choice.

Enter the name of a city to instantly see the current weather conditions of that city. Click on the Imperial / Metric toggle button in the upper-right to swap scales.

This app was build with React and Vite and is integrated with Open Weather's API to provide live weather updates of the cities entered. Future goal is to allow users to save up to 3 cities in the browser's localStorage.
